# Tech Stack Proposal
---
## General Approach
---
The main reason I have chosen the technologies I have was for consistency across all parts. The use of JavaScript throughout all components provides a baseline of consistency.

## Individual Components
---
### Markdown:
- The built-in features of markdown allow for easy conveyance of information.

### JavaScript:
- Given that the final application will be browser-based, JavaScript seemed a natural fit. 

### TypeScript:
- JavaScript is great for promoting a unified approach across many components of an application, but it is loosely typed which can lead to unexpected behavior. TypeScript remedies this and also assists in finding bugs. 

### NodeJS
- NodeJS allows JavaScript to run server-side and promotes async. 

### HapiJS
- Hapi provides what I need out of the box. I can't think of much functionality that I would need for this project that Hapi doesn't already provide, but if something were to present itself, there are many plugins that I could install. 

### Nodemon
- Makes it possible to apply fixes without needing to restart the server every time. 

### Postman
- Used for testing routes in the API without needing to manually run code 

### SQL Server
- This was the last thing I decided on. I was unsure of how to proceed, but I thought something I actully know how to use might be nice.

### Angular
- An opinionated framework can help me better learn how front-end development works. In addition, Angular is TypeScript-based, which lines up nicely with the rest of the stack thus far.
